# StockApp
This application was built using react.js and displays the latest stock history of 15 notable stock companies. It fetches real-time data using the Alpha Vantage API and displays it in an intuitive user interface. Users can search for stocks by ticker symbol, view company overview details, including sector, industry, and market capitalization, and analyze historical price trends through interactive line graphs. 

NOTE: The API key utilized is free so the user only has 25 uses. To fully see functionality uncomment the demo API links in StockDetails.jsx and comment out the API urls along with the API key variable.
